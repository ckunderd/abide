There are some significant issues in the American financial planning industry. Many of the people who need help can’t afford it and others who can afford it often get taken advantage of through excessive investment advisory fees, investment commissions, loads on mutual funds, and excessive fund expenses just to name a few. Correcting these issues takes someone bold enough to offer something unprecedented and with as little bias as possible: free financial planning and education.

To further this effort, Blake Pokley launched Captain, a different kind of financial services provider that works to offer just that: free financial planning and education. As the name Captain describes, Blake’s desire is that every person, no matter their background, would have the opportunity to chart a successful financial course. Blake has been helping individuals and families with financial planning and education for free on his own time for years. Through Captain, he plans to make financial planning and education accessible, easy to understand, and in the recipients’ best interest at all times.

Blake studied Finance and Accounting at Oakland University on a Presidential Scholarship and has worked in the financial planning industry since 2015, becoming a [CFP&reg; professional](https://www.cfp.net/why-cfp-certification/the-standard-of-excellence) in 2019. His trust in Christ gives him the courage to share his knowledge and expertise while only relying on God’s provision as his primary income.
