Oakland County is one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, a community where one would believe those in need could find easy access to resources. Yet, even in the midst of wealth, certain people and communities can find it very difficult to get access to basic needs and valuable relationships due to factors like generational poverty, racial discrimination, literacy struggles, mental and physical sickness, and more. The children of these adults struggling with poverty can be even more at risk, with over 2,000 children in Oakland County considered homeless at the beginning of 2022, and many more on the cusp.

Kids Empowered on the Move was established to serve these children and their familes by providing basic needs like food, literacy, childcare, and employment assistance through ongoing relationships with community members. Currently, over 200 families are served by more than 100 regular volunteers who deliver groceries, read together, and even provide gifts for holidays including Christmas. These relationships are powerful because not only so the help provide basic services, but these families and children fighting poverty can gain access to networks, opportunities, and advocacy they may not otherwise gain through traditional human service agencies.

Founder Kimber Bishop-Yanke is a longtime advocate for children. She ahs previously launched an anti-bullying initiative and consulted many organizations on how to make their environments more safe and secure for children. She and her growing team desire to continue to serve struggling families around the Oakland County communities they call home.
