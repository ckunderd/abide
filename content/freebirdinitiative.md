We are faced with the tragic truth that the United States ranks as one of the worst countries in the world for human trafficking. Individuals from any class, religion, culture, or ethnic group can become targets and often are trafficked by their own families or people in positions of trust. 

Traffickers often manipulate a person’s isolation, substance use or dependency in addition to using violence and threats. Both immigrants and US Citizens are victims of sex trafficking. Thankfully, there are many organizations who are finding and rescuing trafficking victims… but what happens to them after they are rescued?

Free Bird Initiative was created because of a deep love for trafficking survivors that God put in the heart of Shannon Sloan. Shannon has experience working with survivors
starting from age 3 years old and up in The Philippines, Nepal and The United States. Through her experience, she has learned that every survivor has different needs during their healing journey that can keep them trapped in a cycle of shame, fear or dependence in unhealthy situations.

Trauma varies for each person and can affect any aspect of their life: daily functioning, emotional wellbeing, relationships, self-image, goal setting and follow through, mental health and physical health. Free Bird Initiative will meet survivors where they are, taking time to listen and explore the support they need as they move toward healing. It could be as simple as helping them buy groceries if they are struggling or as complex as finding them a new living situation if they don’t feel safe where they are at. By giving to Free Bird Initiative, you are helping survivors know that they are loved, cared for and supported. They may be rescued, but you are helping them become free!

Free Bird Initiative was named in honor of these bible verses:

“Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to Him than they are?” 
Matthew 6:26 NLT

“So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed” 
John 8:36 NIV
