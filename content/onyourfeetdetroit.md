There are thousands of people experiencing homelessness in Detroit. Beyond their obvious needs, homelessness leads to feelings of loneliness and isolation. During the winter months, they face even greater hardships trying to survive the brutal cold weather.

Led by local couple Anthony and Lauren Guastella, On Your Feet Detroit began with a small group of friends handing out essential items to keep people warm during the harsh winter months. Since these humble beginnings in 2015, the efforts have grown as more people have joined in on the mission and more friends experiencing homelessness have been served. Although donations and supplies are needed to support those experiencing homelessness, the main objective is to make the people we serve feel known, loved, and cared for.  

Together with donors and volunteers, On Your Feet Detroit strives to eradicate misconceptions about those experiencing homelessness in order to break down barriers and encourage our community to serve those in need alongside us.  Get on your feet, Detroit - and join in the mission!
