Yang Chen is the founder of Pearl, a relational network designed to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ. Yang immigrated to the United States at the age of 5 for his father's Ph.D. program at Oakland University, quickly finding himself influenced by two very different cultures. At home, his family's Chinese culture established the norm, but at school and with peers, American youth culture provided a very different outlook and influence on his life. This tension between cultures only intensified as Yang grew older, often challenging him throughout high school, college, and into his career as a young adult. 

It was his experience living in this tension that inspired Yang to work to establish Pearl, a relational network that exists to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ. Many Asian Americans are caught up in a battle on two fronts - internally and externally. Within the family, connecting with parents is a unique challenge for emerging Asian American adults especially in navigating the tension between personal desires and family expectations. Externally, relationships with friends, co-workers, and society at large can be challenging especially for emerging adults. Difficult questions are at the forefront of life for many Asian Americans, including, "How do I make friends after college? "How do you connect on the job to ensure career success? How do you deal with racism and discrimination? How can I stay true to my Asian heritage while also assimilating within American culture?"

Pearl primarily aims to address these issues facing young Asian-Americans through one-on-one mentoring. Pearl helps connect younger Asian Americans with spiritually mature, proven, and compassionate mentors from the Asian and Asian-American communities. These mentoring relationships help to empower young Asian Americans, developing their wisdom, perseverance, and voice as the learning partnership grows. To facilitate and strengthen these connections, Pearl also provides written resources that mentors and mentees can discuss, as well as creating social events where young Asian Americans can encourage each other in their spiritual development. 

Yang married his wife Jean in 2018, and they reside in Auburn Hills, Michigan, living out this call to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ together.
