Kyle Vens is the director of Cultivate, a ministry devoted to developing Christlike character in university students so they can grow God's kingdom.

After growing in his Christlike character through Cultivate as a college student at Oakland University, Kyle was named director of the ministry in 2019. Kyle's spiritual gifts of shepherding, teaching, and leadership were all shaped over three years as an undergraduate psychology student from 2016-2019, making him a great fit to share his experience with a new generation of college students at Oakland University and beyond. 

Each student who commits to Cultivate is welcomed into a two year process where their Christlike character is developed in a variety of intentional ways. Through one-on-one mentoring, ministry skill development, and theological training, each student experiences growth in their mind, heart, and abilities to lead others spiritually. 

Cultivate has been discipling university students since 2013, with over 50 alumni going into various vocations with a single focus to grow God's kingdom. Whether in full-time ministry or the marketplace, Cultivate alumni are trusted and sought-after spiritual leaders as a result of their time being intentionally developed.
