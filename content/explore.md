### OVERVIEW

Join the Abide Collective for an afternoon on the Detroit Riverfront! **On Sunday, September 29**, You will be able to meet the creative and courageous leaders of the Abide Collective, learn more about the beautiful work they are doing, and build relationships new and old.

##### 3-4 PM Stroll

Each branch of the Abide Collective will be in a different spot along the Riverfront at the new Milliken State Park and Harbor. You will be able to chat with any branch you desire, learning who they are as people and the work they feel called to do.

From 4-5pm, join us for a time of sharing and refreshments. Each branch of the Abide Collective will have a chance to share what is happening with their work, and we will conclude by praying together in gratitude for what God has done, as well as God's will for the future.
