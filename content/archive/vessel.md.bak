In the spring of 2018, Charli Carnill felt the call of Jesus to leave her collegiate softball career and community of friends at Cornerstone University in order to offer herself as a servant to those suffering the effects of poverty and injustice all over the world. While a vessel describes any container which carries something, Charli's desire is to be a vessel which carries the love of Christ to those who may be struggling to find it. 

Charli spent the fall of 2018 in Cape Town, South Africa working with Extreme Response International, volunteering in their Dream Centre, an after school tutoring program for at-risk children. She will be returning there this spring to continue working with the children and lead a team of interns. This will also afford Charli the opportunity to continue discovering a long-term call into missions.
