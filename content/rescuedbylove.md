Over and over again we hear stories of people whose lives look great on the outside, but when their marriage falls apart, there is suicide, or other life altering circumstances occur, we find that they were fighting a battle that nobody knew about. We live in a world where most people have been trained to love superficially or not at all. Because of this, there is a struggle to find spaces where people are allowed to be honest with where they are and to find help in discovering their true value in the eyes of the Father. Rescued by Love Ministries creates spaces for people to discover and rediscover how powerful the love of God is and its ability to set captives free. RBL encourages people to be authentic in their journey of loving God, and then help them to understand the power of loving themselves through his love. These individuals are then taught how to go out and take what they have discovered to others who might be hiding and hurting among them.


Simone Cato has had a heart for the lost, lonely and unlovable since she was a child. She grew up in Jamaica, spending much of her time during college ministering to homeless youth, sharing the love of Jesus with women who were sex workers, and loving on people who did not feel like they belonged in the church. Over the years, the thing that has remained powerful and consistent in her life is the way God has used his love to break bondages in people's lives, whether believers or people who were curious about the faith.  Over the years, Simone and her husband Steve have opened their home in many ways to people who need to experience the love and healing of Christ.

Rescued by Love has a vision of going into spaces locally and internationally to help teach and model authenticity and love through retreats, conferences, intimate worship gatherings, bible study, and prayer meetings. They have done this in Michigan, Jamaica, and Germany, but are always looking for opportunities to partner with other believers wherever they are needed.
