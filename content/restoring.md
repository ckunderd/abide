Since 2001, Joshua and Yvette Rock have been living in Detroit, building friendships and raising their family, hoping to witness and encourage God’s restoration among the people and in the neighborhoods of Detroit. Restoring has developed out of this desire, as a way to support and encourage friends in the process of believing, following, submitting, and abiding in Jesus. As Joshua and Yvette share life with their friends in the city, they work to strengthen marriages and families, meet with men and women, and serve their neighbors in practical ways.

Joshua and Yvette’s call and service involves making and supporting disciples of Jesus through prayer and the continuing command to love God and love one another. Joshua and Yvette do this work while reflecting their passion for teaching, art, and community.
