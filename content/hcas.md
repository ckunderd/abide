Haiti Children’s Aid Society USA was established in 2019 to provide support to the orphaned and impoverished children of Mirebalais, Haiti. 

Haiti Children’s Aid Society has five major purposes. First, we are committed to relieving poverty by providing basic amenities, medical and health care, and basic social services to orphaned and impoverished children in Haiti. Second, we are invested in improving the quality of life and drinking water in Haiti through construction of wells and water treatment — giving the gift of “living water” for the body, mind and the spirit of every child. Third, we are devoted to advancing the quality of education for children in Haiti by providing books, equipment, scholarships and educational aids. Fourth, we are pledged to provide support services and programs to parents in the United States who have adopted Haitian children. Finally, we are committed to providing opportunities for supporters to be transformed by life-changing experiences as they participate “hands-on” by going on short and long-term service visits to Haiti as well as encouraging these supporters to consider adoption, as many of those involved have to date.

One of the key ways Haiti Children’s Aid Society USA knows the needs of these children is through a relationship with [Haiti Children’s Home](http://haitichildrenshome.com/), a local orphanage in Mirebalais.
