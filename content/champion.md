Champion exists to help local professional and amateur athletes encounter the love and truth of Christ in order to help them become fully devoted followers of Jesus. Through Bible studies, Sunday gatherings, friendly hospitality, and individual mentoring, Champion provides real friendship and Christ-centered life guidance to players in local professional baseball leagues, with plans to expand to more sports in the near future.
 
Launched in 2016 by Tony DeMonaco, Champion now has 10 chaplains who work with young men in the United Shore Professional Baseball League, an independent professional league headquartered in Utica, MI. Tony and his fellow chaplains desire to have relationships with members of every team in the 4-team league, as well as begin the process of reaching out to other sports leagues in the metro Detroit area.
