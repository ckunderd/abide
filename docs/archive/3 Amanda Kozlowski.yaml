bio: Amanda, her husband Josh, and their three children live in the Detroit area and have been serving the local community for over 10 years. Amanda is sharing her years of ministry experience alongside other team members to support the work of starting and sustaining new initiatives that will serve the vulnerable and the oppressed. If you ask Amanda what the best job she ever had was, she will probably say it is a toss up between what she is now doing with Abide and the first job she ever had as a 16 year old working at Ben and Jerry's ice-cream. While she does love helping others come to know freedom in Jesus, step into their God-given identity and live fully authentic lives...she is also very fond of ice-cream so it really is hard to say.
