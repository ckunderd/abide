						<p>There are some significant issues in the American financial planning industry. Many of the people who need help can’t afford it and others who can afford it often get taken advantage of through excessive investment advisory fees, investment commissions, loads on mutual funds, and excessive fund expenses just to name a few. Correcting these issues takes someone bold enough to offer something unprecedented and with as little bias as possible: free financial planning and education.</p>
<p>To further this effort, Blake Pokley launched Captain, a different kind of financial services provider that works to offer just that: free financial planning and education. As the name Captain describes, Blake’s desire is that every person, no matter their background, would have the opportunity to chart a successful financial course. Blake has been helping individuals and families with financial planning and education for free on his own time for years. Through Captain, he plans to make financial planning and education accessible, easy to understand, and in the recipients’ best interest at all times.</p>
<p>Blake studied Finance and Accounting at Oakland University on a Presidential Scholarship and has worked in the financial planning industry since 2015, becoming a <a href="https://www.cfp.net/why-cfp-certification/the-standard-of-excellence">CFP® professional</a> in 2019. His trust in Christ gives him the courage to share his knowledge and expertise while only relying on God’s provision as his primary income.</p>

						<p>In December 2004, at age 41, Karen Rohner became a widow. In an instant, she went from being a happy mother and wife to a confused, scared and lonely widow and single mom of 2 teenagers.  She found the only thing harder than dealing with losing her husband was watching her kids grieve and suffer from the loss of their father.</p>
<p>Through a series of fortunate connections, Karen was introduced to 4 other young widows who also recently lost their husbands. They instantly connected as they all realized they had similar struggles, and they often gathered to talk about life, feelings, and struggles they faced as new widows.</p>
<p>Ever since connecting with these friends, Karen’s passion to support and connect with other widows has grown. After receiving her certification as a Life Coach in 2017, she decided to move forward and start a new ministry through Abide to serve widows called Motion.</p>
<p>Motion ministers to widows in the lonely time that settles in once supportive friends and family have returned to normal life. Motion’s discipleship process takes widows from loneliness to the motion of walking with and serving with Christ. Through one-on-one mentoring, small groups, and prayer, Motion helps widows build new friendships that will remain strong through the continual struggles all widows face.</p>

						<p>Yang Chen is the founder of Pearl, a relational network designed to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ.</p>
<p>Yang immigrated to the US at the age of 5 for his father’s PhD program at Oakland University. He quickly found himself being influenced by two very different cultures. At home, his family’s Chinese culture established the norm, but at school and with peers, American youth culture provided a very different outlook and influence on his life. This tension between cultures only intensified as Yang grew older, peaking after college. The lack of alignment between career aspirations and family expectations created conflict within the home. Coupled with a great desire to find love, his mental health declined during this time. However, Yang also discovered that he was not alone and started to connect with and mentored others who were struggling too. This is the inspiration behind Pearl.</p>
<p>Pearl addresses the issues young Asian Americans face through one-on-one mentoring. Pearl helps connect these emerging adults with relatable, spiritually mature, proven, and compassionate mentors. These mentoring relationships facilitates the development of wisdom, perseverance, and personal voice. To strengthen these connections, Pearl also provides written resources that they can discuss, as well as creating social events for networking and mutual encouragement.</p>
<p>Yang married his wife Jean in 2018, and they reside in Auburn Hills, Michigan, living out this call to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ together.</p>
