<h2>About <span class="overview-name">Gracefilled Giving</span></h2>
<p>Gracefilled Giving exists to give grace and support to those who need short term help in a variety of areas, especially those who are often overlooked by others. Gracefilled Giving not only believes that we as God&rsquo;s people receive God&rsquo;s grace, but also that we are able to share our blessings and give grace to others. Gracefilled Giving also creates a space in which people can give of their time, possessions, finances, and prayers to support others.</p>
<p>Angi began in the mission field in Junior High where she first helped to repair houses in the Appalachian Mountains with her church. It was there that she met a 90 year old women named Connie who would change her life forever. To most of the world, Connie had nothing. No money, no running water, limited food, and barely a roof over her head. Throughout the week, Connie shared with Angi how blessed she was to know Christ. She would say over and over &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Grace is enough. I don&rsquo;t need a lot, I just need
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 30 years later, Connie&rsquo;s words remain with Angi, and her passion for helping people has only grown stronger. Much of her life has been working with individuals and families who have loved ones with special needs. She and her husband Gerald have provided many years of their lives dedicated to providing long term care and short term respite care in their home. Although retired from teaching special education, Angi continues to support families when they need help with Individual Education
Plans, obtaining services in the community, help with DHS paperwork and resources, and navigating the world of obtaining needed medical equipment and appointments.</p>
<p>Angi and Gerald are passionate about serving those who society often sees as “less than”. These are children, adults, families, the differently abled, and people with hurts, habits and hang-ups. They provide assistance to families in need of groceries, clothing, furniture, bedding, hygiene products and more. They seek connections with people by sharing meals with people, learning their names, and listening to their stories. They believe it is through the grace they have been given that they can in return, share God&rsquo;s grace with others. Angi says &ldquo;You have to give Grace, if you expect to receive Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 12:9, &ldquo;But he said to me &lsquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&rsquo; Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&rsquo;s power may rest on me.</p>
