						<p>Oakland County is one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, a community where one would believe those in need could find easy access to resources. Yet, even in the midst of wealth, certain people and communities can find it very difficult to get access to basic needs and valuable relationships due to factors like generational poverty, racial discrimination, literacy struggles, mental and physical sickness, and more. The children of these adults struggling with poverty can be even more at risk, with over 2,000 children in Oakland County considered homeless at the beginning of 2022, and many more on the cusp.</p>
<p>Kids Empowered on the Move was established to serve these children and their familes by providing basic needs like food, literacy, childcare, and employment assistance through ongoing relationships with community members. Currently, over 200 families are served by more than 100 regular volunteers who deliver groceries, read together, and even provide gifts for holidays including Christmas. These relationships are powerful because not only so the help provide basic services, but these families and children fighting poverty can gain access to networks, opportunities, and advocacy they may not otherwise gain through traditional human service agencies.</p>
<p>Founder Kimber Bishop-Yanke is a longtime advocate for children. She ahs previously launched an anti-bullying initiative and consulted many organizations on how to make their environments more safe and secure for children. She and her growing team desire to continue to serve struggling families around the Oakland County communities they call home.</p>

						<p>For decades, a those who identify as bi/multi-racial have been overlooked within society. Whether in families, neighborhoods, communities of faith, or otherwise, these individuals are often seen as &ldquo;half&rdquo; of one idenity and &ldquo;half&rdquo; of another, and as such are rarely fully embraced. This &ldquo;half existence&rdquo; leads to bullying, disillusionment, poor mental health, and a host of other issues that do not reflect God&rsquo;s desires for their lives, which is all the more concerning when one considers that those who identify as bi/multi-racial will be the majority of people in the United States by 2040.</p>
<p>Two or More was created to help bring about a brighter future for community members and their families who represent two or more racial or ethnic backgrounds. This ministry creates spaces to explore the wholeness of who these individuals are and not merely one part, established on the belief that racial reconiclaiton starts with knowing fully who one is in Christ, and continues by bringing awareness to all those to whom these people are connected.</p>
<p>Founded by Brian Petty, a multi-ethnic Black and Korean leader born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Two or More provides social gatherings, immersion trips, and curriculum to help the bi/multi-ethnic individual, their children, and their families celebrate the fullness of their background. Brian uses both his years of study and personal life experience to develop all of the experiences, while also personally connecting with those that struggle understanding two or more ethnic identities within themsleves. He believes that when these individuals learn to be undivided within and realizes that they are created wholly, bridge building can truly begin.</p>
