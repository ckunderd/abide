      <description>WHAT IT MEANS TO ABIDE In the last few years, Abide Ministries has expanded its reach by helping to start and sustain new initiatives that help people intimately know the love of God. Taken together, these initiatives are known as the Abide Collective. Some collective ministries serve human trafficking victims, others semi-professional athletes, individual and community needs through art and reconciliation, and still others international students, helping each person they encounter to hear from God just as we desire to do.</description>

      <description>Over several years, Donna McCauley has developed friendships with men and women on the streets of Detroit and families who need encouragement in their faith. Donna, along with her 70x7 team of friends who have a long term commitment to encouraging others, spend time with these individuals and families on a weekly basis. Encouragement is given in the form of friendship, dignity, bible study, prayer and the meeting of a few basic needs, all with the view of helping individuals and families navigate away from at-risk activities and toward Jesus.</description>

      <description>For over a decade, Renee Mulliniks and Nancy Zott have made it their mission to help children discover their identity in Christ through arts-based curriculum and programs. Their shared goal has been to help children find what they are good at and know there is a purpose for why they were given that talent, to face their fears and build confidence in a safe and loving environment, and finally to share their stories with others in order to become leaders among their peers.</description>

      <description>Yang Chen is the founder of Pearl, a relational network designed to help Asian Americans flourish in Christ. Yang immigrated to the United States at the age of 5 for his father&amp;rsquo;s Ph.D. program at Oakland University, quickly finding himself influenced by two very different cultures. At home, his family&amp;rsquo;s Chinese culture established the norm, but at school and with peers, American youth culture provided a very different outlook and influence on his life.</description>

      <description>This world often feels like a battle between us and them. We look for people who are like us, who look like us, who like what we would like, and who make us feel comfortable. Meanwhile, we are constantly categorizing the people who don’t fit the definition of us as “them”. “Them” is whoever is not like us, for all the reasons that we believe. Whether conscious or unconscious, we are looking for ways to define our world so we know the difference between us and them.</description>

      <description>In the spring of 2018, Charli Carnill felt the call of Jesus to leave her collegiate softball career and community of friends at Cornerstone University in order to offer herself as a servant to those suffering the effects of poverty and injustice all over the world. While a vessel describes any container which carries something, Charli&amp;rsquo;s desire is to be a vessel which carries the love of Christ to those who may be struggling to find it.</description>
